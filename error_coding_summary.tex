\section{Classification of User Errors}
Total entries from first attempt (raw\_user\_address): 21,927
\\Total entries from second attempt (raw\_user\_address\_2): 1,265

\section{Successful Entries}
The first step is to remove all of entries that successfully returned an address (ward != blank). Overall, there were  5,475 successes on the first attempt and additional 302 successes produced on the second attempt. 


There were multiple ways the ward numbers were produced on the first try (either correctly or incorrectly):
\begin{itemize}
\item Full address (minimum of street number + name): 1,531
\item Partial address (zip code): 816
\item Partial address (city name or some other identifier): 1,683
\item Erroneous input (uninformative number, random text/punctuation): 1,694
\item Miscellaneous: 53
\end{itemize}


\section{Categorizing Errors}
After removing entries that successfully generated a ward number, while leaving those that generated a match, but only after the second try, there are 16,506 errors in raw\_user\_address to code.
